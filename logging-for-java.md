SLF4J - The Simple Logging Facade for Java (SLF4J) serves as a simple facade or abstraction1 for various logging frameworks (e.g. java.util.logging, logback, log4j) allowing the end user to plug in the desired logging framework at deployment time.

Log4j 1.2 - Welcome to Apache log4j, a logging library for Java.

Logback - Logback is intended as a successor to the popular log4j project, picking up where log4j leaves off.

Log4j 2 - Apache Log4j 2 is an upgrade to Log4j that provides significant improvements over its predecessor, Log4j 1.x, and provides many of the improvements available in Logback while fixing some inherent problems in Logback's architecture.

At least, that's what they all say of themselves.
